            <h3>Cafe Coffee Day</h3>
            <p>Café Coffee Day (CCD) is a large and popular coffeehouse chain in India, known for its role in shaping Indian urban culture and its focus on providing a welcoming space for people to connect, work, or relax over coffee. Founded in 1996 by V.G. Siddhartha, CCD grew to become the largest organized retail cafe chain in the country, with a vast network of cafes across India.
            <br><br>
            Café Coffee Day Global Limited Company is a Chikkamagaluru-based business which grows coffee in its own estates of 20,000 acres. It is the largest producer of arabica beans in Asia, exporting to various countries including U.S., Europe, and Japan.
            <br><br>
            V. G. Siddhartha started the café chain in 1996 when he incorporated Coffee Day Global, which is the parent of the Coffee Day chain.The first CCD outlet was set up on July 11, 1996, at Brigade Road, Bangalore, Karnataka. It rapidly expanded to other cities in India, with more than 1,000 cafés open across the nation by 2011.
            <br><br>
            In 2010, it was announced that a consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts would invest ₹1,000 crore (equivalent to ₹22 billion or US$270 million in 2023) in Coffee Day Resorts, owned by the company. The same year, the logo was changed to the current logo, which the company stated was to showcase the chain as a place to talk.This was done with major changes in the layout of the stores, including the addition of lounges and a total revamp of the interiors.
